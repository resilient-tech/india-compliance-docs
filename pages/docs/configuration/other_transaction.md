## GST on Advanced Payments

As per GST laws in India, where advances are received from a customer, there is a liability to pay GST on such advance receipts. This liability is then adjusted when the advance is adjusted against the supply made. Following example will help understand how this transaction will work with India Compliance.

### Advance Payment Receipt

Resilient Tech receives a payment of Rs. 10000/- from a customer. Resilient Tech is expecting to charge GST @ 18% in relation to the planned supply.

Advance payment received will be considered as amount received including GST. Resilient Tech is therefore liable to pay GST of Rs. 1525.42/- on this advance receipt.

One month later, Resilient Tech supplies services worth Rs. 20000/- + GST to the customer. Advance Payment received above is adjusted against the supply of services.
