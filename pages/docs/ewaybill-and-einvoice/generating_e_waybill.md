# e-Waybill
e-Waybill is an electronic waybill required to be generated on [e-Waybill Portal](https://ewaybillgst.gov.in/) for the movement of goods. India Compliance offers multiple ways to manage your e-Waybill compliance.

You can generate the e-Waybill using the bulk generation facility or the APIs.

## Supported DocTypes to generate e-Waybill

- Sales Invoice
- Purchase Invoice
- Delivery Note
- Purchase Receipt
- Stock Entry
- Subcontracting Receipt

## Prerequisites
- [GSP credentials in ERPNext](gst_settings#gsp-credentials)
- [India Compliance Account](../getting-started/india_compliance_account#account-creation)
- API should be enabled under GST Settings.
- [e-Waybill Configration](gst_settings#e-waybill-settings)

## e-Waybill Generation Using API
 
- On submitting the sales invoice, e-Waybill shall be automatically generated (*if enabled in settings*).
- You can manually trigger the generation of an e-Waybill for Delivery Note or where all fields were not present (on submit).

**Go to the e-Waybill menu --> Generate dialog --> Update fields and click Generate.**

#### How would I know if only Part A of the e-Waybill will be generated?

Dialog for Generate e-Waybill fields has separate sections for Part A and Part B. Also, the Primary Action button will denote if only Part A can be generated.

#### How to auto calculate the distance for e-Waybill?

If the distance is set to zero (0), e-Waybill Portal will suggest the distance between postal codes. We shall update it to your document where e-Waybill is generated using the APIs.

*In some exceptional circumstances, where the distance between postal codes is unavailable with the e-Waybill database, you shall receive a prompt. Generate the e-Waybill again after entering the distance as per your estimate.*  

## Update Transporter Details

::: warning
Updating or cancelling e-Waybill is possible only within the validity period. These options will be visible only if you have generated the e-Waybill using API and the validity to do so has not expired.
:::

Use this feature to update the GSTIN of the transporter to your e-Waybill.  

**From e-Waybill menu --> Select Update Transporter --> Update appropriate information and click update.**

**From e-Waybill menu --> Select Update Vehicle Info --> Update information in dialog and click update.**

> There is a checkbox in the dialogs above for `Update e-Waybill Print/Data`. If you check this, we shall update the attachments of the e-Waybill or Data concerning the e-Waybill as per your preference from GST settings for e-Waybill. If `Attach e-Waybill Print After Generation` is enabled from GST Settings, new attachments will replace old attachments.

## Print e-Waybill
You can use this to print an e-Waybill if you prefer not to have attachments. It works similarly to printing any other document in ERPNext. It will redirect you to the respective e-Waybill log print and fetch the latest e-Waybill data (from the NIC Portal) for printing if it's not available.

You can print e-waybill in two formats similar to the e-Waybill portal: 
1. A Simplified Format using "e-Waybill" print format
2. A Detailed Format with additional fields using "e-Waybill Detailed" print format

  <img src="./assets/e_waybill_detailed.png" alt="E-Waybill Detailed " width="50%" style="border-radius:8px">
</div>

## Attach e-Waybill
It is a manual trigger to attach an e-Waybill to a Sales Invoice. A new attachment will replace the old attachment if present.

## Cancel e-Waybill
If within validity, you shall be allowed to cancel the e-Waybill.  
From the e-Waybill menu, Cancel e-Waybill. In the cancellation dialog, Specify the reason for cancelling and click cancel to cancel the e-Waybill.
>*While you cancel the e-Waybill, the attachment of the old e-Waybill, shall be removed.*
