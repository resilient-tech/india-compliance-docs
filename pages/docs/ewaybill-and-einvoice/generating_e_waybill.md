# e-Waybill
e-Waybill is an electronic waybill required to be generated on [e-Waybill Portal](https://ewaybillgst.gov.in/) for the movement of goods. India Compliance offers multiple ways to manage your e-Waybill compliance.

You can generate the e-Waybill using the bulk generation facility or the APIs.

## Prerequisites
- [GSP credentials in ERPNext](gst_settings#gsp-credentials)
- [India Compliance Account](../getting-started/india_compliance_account#account-creation)
- API should be enabled under GST Settings.
- [e-Waybill Configration](gst_settings#e-waybill-settings)

## e-Waybill Generation Using API
 
- On submitting the sales invoice, e-Waybill shall be automatically generated (*if enabled in settings*).
- You can manually trigger the generation of e-Waybill for Delivery Note or where all fields were not present (on submit).

**Go to the e-Waybill menu --> Generate dialog --> Update fields and click Generate.**

#### How would I know if only Part A of the e-Waybill will be generated?

Dialog for Generate e-Waybill fields have separate sections for Part A and Part B. Also, the Primary Action button will denote if only Part A can be generated.

#### How to auto calculate the distance for e-Waybill?

If the distance is set to zero (0), e-Waybill Portal will suggest the distance between postal codes. We shall update it to your document where e-Waybill is generated using the APIs.

*In some exceptional circumstances, where the distance between postal codes is unavailable with the e-Waybill database, you shall receive a prompt. Generate e-Waybill again after entering the distance as per your estimate.*  

## Update Transporter Details

::: warning
Updating or cancelling e-Waybill is possible only within the validity period. These options will be visible only if you have generated the e-Waybill using API and the validity to do so is not expired.

Use this feature to update the GSTIN of the transporter to your e-Waybill.  

**From e-Waybill menu --> Select Update Transporter --> Update appropriate information and click update.**
